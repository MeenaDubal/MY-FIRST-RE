Project using Python and ML
A retail chain with numerous outlets nationwide is encountering challenges in effectively managing inventory to align demand with supply. The provided dataset includes weekly sales data for various outlets. The task involves utilizing statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and outlier analysis to address missing values and derive insights. Additionally, predictive modeling techniques will be employed to forecast sales for each store over the next 12 weeks. This comprehensive approach aims to provide valuable perspectives for improved inventory management and sales predictions.

Project using Power BI
Description: Survey conducted in U.S. stores on student spending (Video games, Indoor games, Toys, Books, Gadgets). Extract insights using the "Store setting" column in the Student Survey dataset to understand store types. Use Case: Top Down and Bottoms Up Analysis to identify Shipping Costs Leakages
Source: Superstore Sales | Analytics: Build a set of visualizations to identify underlying outliers and flip the same set of visualizations to perform bottom-up analysis.
